# What are the brand I am selecting 

1. System 76
	1. Serval WS
	2. Oryx Prop
	3. Bonobo WS
2. Apple
	1. Macbook Pro
3. Framework 
	1. The best version of 16 inch laptop of framework will cost 2475 dollars. 

# What are the properties I am comparing the 

1. CPU, I want the highest number of CPU cores as possible. Problems, like Reinforcement learning major bottleneck is number of cpu cores. 


# Memory

1. DDR5 5600 32 GB.
	1. I perfer a single large memory stick to make sure the data does not have to transfer to single 16 GB. I don't want to make sure the memory constraint will make an issues on this topics 
# Primary Storage

1. The storage need to be a size equal or greater than 1 Terabytes
2. The read and write speeds need to be fast 


# What are the different Primary Storage

# CPU

1. The requirement for a new cpu must be greater performance than 13 gen Intel CPU


1. Intel
2. AMD
	1. [AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series](https://frame.work/marketplace/laptops?compatibility%5B%5D=amd_ryzen_7040_series)
	2.  AMD Ryzen™ 9 7940HS   Radeon™ 780M Graphics
	3. Comparing the perforamnces of Ryaazen 9 7940Hs
		1. Both the AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS and the Apple M3 feature 8 CPU cores. However, the Ryzen 9 7940HS supports 16 threads thanks to Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), whereas the Apple M3 processes 8 threads, indicating a difference in multitasking capabilities
		2. **Clock Speed**: The Ryzen 9 7940HS has a higher maximum clock speed of 5.20 GHz compared to the M3's 4.06 GHz, suggesting potentially better performance in single-threaded tasks
		3. **Memory Support**: The Ryzen 9 7940HS supports up to 256 GB of memory, significantly more than the M3's 24 GB limit, catering to more memory-intensive applications

### Apple
3. Apple
	1. Apple M2 Pro 12-Core CPU 30-core GPU Chip
	2. M3

#### M1

		- So, while the M1 GPU supports offers a noticeable boost compared to the M1 CPU, it’s not a total game changer, and we probably still want to stick to conventional GPUs for our neural network training. The M1 Ultra of the Mac Studio comes closer to Nvidia GPU performance, but we have to consider that this is an expensive (~$5k) machine![2]

### Intel

1. The latest CPU intel need to at the level of 14 generation of intel cpu that have Performance and 
		1.  Serval WS, Oryx Pro, and Bonobo WS are being updated with the 14th Gen Intel CPUs, including the i9-14900HX for enhanced performance
### AMD

# GPU

1. You need to have graphic acards is expensives . It better to use a mobile devices macbook pro will kjust be better [1]

# Machine Learning on the Mobile devices


1. Apple
	1. "Comparing the performance of machine learning task on a single Macbook pro 64 gis of ram will out perform mobile gpu on laptop that havess less than 8 gigs of vram,"[1]  however the price of 3.2 grands
2. Non Apple

# Portability 


## Weight 

- The weight of the Framework Laptop 16 varies depending on the configuration. Without any expansion modules, the laptop weighs 2.1kg (approximately 4.63 pounds). When equipped with the Graphics Module, the weight increases to 2.4kg (approximately 5.29 pounds)[1][6]. This variation in weight is due to the different components that can be added to the laptop, such as the Graphics Module, which adds additional weight compared to the standard Expansion Bay Shell configuration.
